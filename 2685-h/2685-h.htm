    <p>
      ATHALIA HALL stopped to get her breath and look back over the road
      climbing steeply up from the covered bridge. It was a little after five,
      and the delicate air of dawn was full of wood and pasture scents&mdash;the
      sweetness of bay and the freshness of dew-drenched leaves. In the valley
      night still hung like gauze under the trees, but the top of the hill was
      glittering with sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;ve hardly come halfway!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband, plodding along behind her, nodded ruefully. &ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her slim prettiness Athalia Hall looked like a girl, but she was
      thirty-four. Part of the girlishness lay in the smoothness of her white
      forehead and in the sincere intensity of her gaze. She wore a blue linen
      dress, and there was a little, soft, blue scarf under her chin; her white
      hat, with pink roses and loops of gray-blue ribbon, shadowed eager,
      unhumorous eyes, the color of forget-me-nots. Her husband was her senior
      by several years&mdash;a large, loose-limbed man, with a scholarly face
      and mild, calm eyes&mdash;eyes that were full of a singular tenacity of
      purpose. Just now his face showed the fatigue of the long climb up-hill;
      and when his wife, stopping to look back over the glistening tops of the
      birches, said, &ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s half a mile to the top yet!&rdquo; he agreed,
      breathlessly. &ldquo;Hard work!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be worth it when I get to the top and can see the view!&rdquo; she
      declared, and began to climb again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same, this road will be mighty hot when the sun gets full on it,&rdquo;
       her husband said; and added, anxiously, &ldquo;I wish I had made you rest in the
      station until train-time.&rdquo; She flung out her hands with an exclamation:
      &ldquo;Rest! I hate rest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, and I&rsquo;ll give you a stick,&rdquo; he called to her; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a help when
      you&rsquo;re climbing.&rdquo; He pulled down a slender birch, and, setting his foot on
      it, broke it off at the root. She stopped, with an impatient gesture, and
      waited while he tore off handfuls of leaves and whittled away the
      side-shoots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do hurry, Lewis!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had left their train at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and had been
      sitting in the frowsy station, sleepily awaiting the express, when Athalia
      had had this fancy for climbing the hill so that she might see the view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks pretty steep,&rdquo; her husband warned her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be something to do, anyhow!&rdquo; she said; and added, with a restless
      sigh, &ldquo;but you don&rsquo;t understand that, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I do&mdash;after a fashion,&rdquo; he said, smiling at her. It was only
      in love&rsquo;s fashion, for really he was incapable of quite understanding her.
      To the country lawyer of sober piety and granite sense of duty, the rich
      variety of her moods was a continual wonder and sometimes a painful
      bewilderment. But whether he understood the impetuous inconsequence of her
      temperament &ldquo;after a fashion,&rdquo; or whether he failed entirely to follow the
      complexity of her thought, he met all her fancies with a sort of tender
      admiration. People said that Squire Hall was henpecked; they also said
      that he had married beneath him. His father had been a judge and his
      grandfather a minister; he himself was a graduate of a fresh-water
      college, which later, when he published his exegesis on the Prophet
      Daniel, had conferred its little degree upon him and felt that he was a
      &ldquo;distinguished son.&rdquo; With such a lineage he might have done better, people
      said, than to marry that girl, who was the most fickle creature and no
      housekeeper, and whose people&mdash;this they told one another in reserved
      voices&mdash;were PLAY-ACTORS! Athalia&rsquo;s mother, who had been the
      &ldquo;play-actor,&rdquo; had left her children an example of duty&mdash;domestic as
      well as professional duty&mdash;faithfully done. As she did not leave
      anything else, Athalia added nothing to the Hall fortune; but Lewis&rsquo;s law
      practice, which was hardly more than conveyancing now and then, was helped
      out by a sawmill which the Halls had owned for two generations. So, as
      things were, they were able to live in humdrum prosperity which gave Lewis
      plenty of time to browse about among his grandfather&rsquo;s old theological
      books, and by-and-by to become a very sound Hebrew scholar, and spared
      Athalia much wholesome occupation which would have been steadying to her
      eager nature. She was one of those people who express every passing
      emotion, as a flower expresses each wind that sways it upon its stalk. But
      with expression the emotion ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she isn&rsquo;t fickle,&rdquo; Lewis had defended her once to a privileged
      relation who had made the accusation, basing it on the fact that Athalia
      had sewed her fingers off for the Missionary Society one winter and done
      nothing the next&mdash;&ldquo;Athalia ISN&rsquo;T fickle,&rdquo; Lewis explained; &ldquo;fickle
      people are insincere. Athalia is perfectly sincere, but she is temporary;
      that&rsquo;s all. Anyway, she wants to do something else this winter, and
      &lsquo;Thalia must have her head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your head&rsquo;s better than hers, young man,&rdquo; the venturesome relative
      insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it must be her head and not mine, Aunty, when it comes to doing what
      she thinks is right, even if it&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; he said, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, tell her she&rsquo;s a little fool!&rdquo; cried the old lady, viciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that with &lsquo;Thalia,&rdquo; Lewis explained, patiently, &ldquo;because it
      would make her unhappy. She takes everything so dreadfully hard; she feels
      things more than other people do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lewis,&rdquo; said the little, old, wrinkled, privileged great-aunt, &ldquo;think a
      little less of her feelings and a little more of your own, or you&rsquo;ll make
      a mess of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis Hall was too respectful to tell the old lady what he thought of such
      selfish advice; he merely did not act upon it. Instead, he went on giving
      a great deal of thought to Athalia&rsquo;s &ldquo;feelings.&rdquo; That was why he and she
      were climbing the hill in the dewy silence of this August morning. Athalia
      had &ldquo;felt&rdquo; that she wanted to see the view&mdash;though it would have been
      better for her to have rested in the station, Lewis thought;&mdash;(&ldquo;I
      ought to have coaxed her out of it,&rdquo; he reproached himself.) It certainly
      was a hard walk, considering that it followed a broken night in the
      sleeping-car. They had left the train at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and
      were sitting in the station awaiting the express when Athalia had had this
      impulse to climb the hill. &ldquo;It looks pretty steep,&rdquo; Lewis objected; and
      she flung out her hands with an impatient gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love to climb!&rdquo; she said. So here they were, almost at the top, panting
      and toiling, Athalia&rsquo;s skirts wet with dew, and Lewis&rsquo;s face drawn with
      fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all open! We can sit down and see all over the
      world!&rdquo; She left the road, springing lightly through the fringing bay and
      briers toward an open space on the hillside. &ldquo;There is a gate in the
      wall!&rdquo; she called out; &ldquo;it seems to be some sort of enclosure. Lewis, help
      me to open the gate! Hurry! What a queer place! What do you suppose it
      is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gate opened into a little field bounded by a stone wall; the grass had
      been lately mowed, and the stubble, glistening with dew, showed the
      curving swaths of the scythe; across it, in even lines from wall to wall,
      were rows of small stakes painted black. Here and there were faint
      depressions, low, green cradles in the grass; each depression was marked
      at the head and foot by these iron stakes, hardly higher than the stubble
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shakers&rsquo; graveyard, I guess,&rdquo; Lewis said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that they don&rsquo;t use
      gravestones. Peaceful place, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her vivid face was instantly grave. &ldquo;Very peaceful! Oh,&rdquo; she added, as
      they sat down in the shadow of a pine, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you sometimes want to lie
      down and sleep&mdash;deep down in the grass and flowers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he confessed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it would be as interesting as
      walking round on top of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, now,&rdquo; he defended himself, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t take much to peace yourself
      at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo; she said, passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, little Tay,&rdquo; he said, smiling, and putting a soothing hand
      on hers; &ldquo;I guess I do&mdash;after a fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was very still; below them the valley had suddenly brimmed with
      sunshine that flickered and twinkled on the birch leaves or shimmered on
      sombre stretches of pine and spruce. Close at hand, pennyroyal grew thick
      in the shadow of the wall; and just beyond, mullen candles cast slender
      bars of shade across the grass. The sunken graves and the lines of iron
      markers lay before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How quiet it is!&rdquo; she said, in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll smoke,&rdquo; Lewis said, and scratched a match on his trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you!&rdquo; she protested; &ldquo;it is profane!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave her an amused look, but lighted his cigar and smoked dreamily for
      a minute; then he drew a long breath. &ldquo;I was pretty tired,&rdquo; he said, and
      turned to glance back at the road. A horse and cart were coming in at the
      open gate; the elderly driver, singing to himself, drew up abruptly at the
      sight of the two under the pine-tree, then drove toward them, the wheels
      of the cart jolting cheerfully over the cradling graves. He had a sickle
      in his hand, and as he clambered down from the seat, he said, with
      friendly curiosity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You folks are out early, for the world&rsquo;s people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this a graveyard?&rdquo; Athalia demanded, impetuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yee,&rdquo; he said, smiling; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s our burial-place; we&rsquo;re Shakers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why are there just the stakes&mdash;without names?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should there be names?&rdquo; he said, whimsically; &ldquo;they have new names
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your community? Can we go and visit it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yee; but we&rsquo;re not much to see,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;just men and women, like you.
      Only we&rsquo;re happy. I guess that&rsquo;s all the difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what a difference!&rdquo; she exclaimed; and Lewis smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come up for pennyroyal,&rdquo; the Shaker explained, sociably; &ldquo;it grows
      thick round here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about the Shakers,&rdquo; Athalia pleaded. &ldquo;What do you believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, a simple shrewdness glimmering in his brown eyes, &ldquo;if you
      go to the Trustees&rsquo; House, down there in the valley, Eldress Hannah&rsquo;ll
      tell you all about us. And the sisters have baskets and pretty truck to
      sell&mdash;things the world&rsquo;s people like. Go and ask the Eldress what we
      believe, and she&rsquo;ll show you the baskets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned eagerly to her husband. &ldquo;Never mind the ten-o&rsquo;clock train,
      Lewis. Let us go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could take a later train, all right,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, PLEASE!&rdquo; she entreated, joyously. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll help you pick pennyroyal,&rdquo;
       she added to the Shaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this he would not allow. &ldquo;I doubt you&rsquo;d be careful enough,&rdquo; he said,
      mildly; &ldquo;Sister Lydia was the only female I ever knew who could pick
      herbs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you get paid for the work you do?&rdquo; Athalia asked, practically. Lewis
      flushed at the boldness of such a question, but the old man chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should I pay myself?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You own everything in common, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Lewis said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yee,&rdquo; said the Shaker; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re all brothers and sisters. Nobody tries to
      get ahead of anybody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t believe in marriage?&rdquo; Athalia asserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are as the angels of God,&rdquo; he said, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left them and began to sickle his herbs, with the cheerfully obvious
      purpose of escaping further interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Athalia instantly bubbled over with questions, but Lewis could tell her
      hardly more of the Shakers than she knew already.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t free love,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re decent enough. They believe in
      general love, not particular, I suppose.... &lsquo;Thalia, do you think it&rsquo;s
      worth while to wait over a train just to see the settlement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is! He said they were happy; I would like to see what kind
      of life makes people happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the lighted end of his cigar and smiled, but he said nothing.
      Afterward, as they followed the cart across the field and out into the
      road, Athalia asked the old herb-gatherer many questions about the
      happiness of the community life, which he answered patiently enough. Once
      or twice he tried to draw into their talk the silent husband who walked at
      her side, but Lewis had nothing to say. Only when some reference was made
      to one of the Prophecies did he look up in sudden interest. &ldquo;You take that
      to mean the Judgment, do you?&rdquo; he said. And for the rest of the walk to
      the settlement the two men discussed the point, the Shaker walking with
      one hand on the heavy shaft, for the support it gave him, and Lewis
      keeping step with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the foot of the hill the road widened into a grassy street, on both
      sides of which, under the elms and maples, were the community houses, big
      and substantial, but gauntly plain; their yellow paint, flaking and
      peeling here and there, shone clean and fresh in the sparkle of morning.
      Except for a black cat whose fur glistened like jet, dozing on a white
      doorstep, the settlement, steeped in sunshine, showed no sign of life.
      There was a strange remoteness from time about the place; a sort of
      emptiness, and a silence that silenced even Athalia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where IS everybody?&rdquo; she said, in a lowered voice; as she spoke, a child
      in a blue apron came from an open doorway and tugged a basket across the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there children here?&rdquo; Lewis asked, surprised; and their guide said,
      sadly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as many as there ought to be. The new school laws have made a great
      difference. We&rsquo;ve only got two. Folks used to send &lsquo;em to us to bring up;
      oftentimes they stayed on after they were of age. Sister Lydia came that
      way. Well, well, she tired of us, Lydy did, poor girl! She went back into
      the world twenty years ago, now. And Sister Jane, she was a bound-out
      child, too,&rdquo; he rambled on; &ldquo;she came here when she was six; she&rsquo;s seventy
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; Lewis exclaimed; &ldquo;has she never known anything but&mdash;this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His shocked tone did not disturb the old man. &ldquo;Want to see my herb-house?&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;ll find some of the sisters in the sorting-room. I&rsquo;m
      Nathan Dale,&rdquo; he added, courteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had come to the open door of a great, weather-beaten building, from
      whose open windows an aromatic breath wandered out into the summer air. As
      they crossed the worn threshold, Athalia stopped and caught her breath in
      the overpowering scent of drying herbs; then they followed Brother Nathan
      up a shaky flight of steps to the loft. Here some elderly women, sitting
      on low benches, were sorting over great piles of herbs in silence&mdash;the
      silence, apparently, of peace and meditation. Two of them were dressed
      like world&rsquo;s people, but the others wore small gray shoulder-capes
      buttoned to their chins, and little caps of white net stretched smoothly
      over wire frames; the narrow shirrings inside the frames fitted so close
      to their peaceful, wrinkled foreheads that no hair could be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could sit and sort herbs!&rdquo; Athalia said, under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother Nathan chuckled. &ldquo;For how long?&rdquo; he asked; and then introduced her
      to the three workers, who greeted her calmly and went on sorting their
      herbs. The loft was dark and cool; the window-frames, in which there were
      no sashes, opened wide on the still August fields and woods; the
      occasional brief words of the sorting-women seemed to drop into a pool of
      fragrant silence. The two visitors followed Brother Nathan down the room
      between piles of sorted herbs, and out into the sunshine again. Athalia
      drew a breath of ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all so beautifully tranquil!&rdquo; she whispered, looking about her with
      blue, excited eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tay and tranquillity!&rdquo; Lewis said, with an amused laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as they went along the grassy street this sense of tranquillity closed
      about them like a palpable peace. Now and then they stopped and spoke to
      some one&mdash;always an elderly person; and in each old face the
      experiences that life writes in unerasable lines about eyes and lips were
      hidden by a veil of calmness that was curiously unhuman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t canny, exactly,&rdquo; Lewis told his wife, in a low voice. But she
      did not seem to hear him. She asked many questions of Eldress Hannah, who
      had taken them in charge, and once or twice she burst into impetuous
      appreciation of the idea of brotherhood, and even of certain theological
      principles&mdash;which last diverted her husband very much. Eldress Hannah
      showed them the dairy, and the work-room, and all there was to see, with a
      patient hospitality that kept them at an infinite distance. She answered
      Lewis&rsquo;s questions about the community with a sad directness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yee; there are not many of us now. The world&rsquo;s people say we&rsquo;re dying
      out. But the Lord will preserve the remnant to redeem the world, young
      man. Yee; when they come in from the world they cast their possessions
      into the whole; we own nothing, for ourselves. Nay; we don&rsquo;t have many
      come. Brother William was the last. Why did he come?&rdquo; She looked coldly at
      Athalia, who had asked the question. &ldquo;Because he saw the way to peace.
      He&rsquo;d had strife enough in the world. Yee,&rdquo; she admitted, briefly, &ldquo;some
      fall from grace, and leave us. The last was Lydia. She was one of our
      children, and I thought she was of the chosen. But she was only thirty
      when she fell away, and you can&rsquo;t expect wisdom at that age. That was
      nearly twenty years ago. When she has tasted the dregs of the world she
      will come back to us&mdash;if she lives,&rdquo; Eldress Hannah ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Athalia listened breathlessly, her rapt, unhumorous eyes fixed on Eldress
      Hannah&rsquo;s still face. Now and then she asked a question, and once cried out
      that, after all, why wasn&rsquo;t it the way to live? Peace and self-sacrifice
      and love! &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, turning to her husband, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you feel the
      attraction of it? I should think even you could feel it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I feel it&mdash;after a fashion,&rdquo; he said, mildly; &ldquo;I think I
      have always felt the attraction of community life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Afterward, when they had left all this somnolent peace and begun the long
      walk back to the station, he explained what he meant: &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t say so
      before the Eldress, but of course there are times when anybody can feel
      the charm of getting rid of personal responsibility&mdash;and that is what
      community life really means. It&rsquo;s the relief of being a little cog in a
      big machine; in fact, the very attraction of it is a sort of temptation,
      to my way of looking at it. But it&mdash;well, it made me sleepy,&rdquo; he
      confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For once his wife had no reply. She was very quiet on that return journey
      in the cars, and in the days that followed she kept referring to their
      visit with a persistence that surprised her husband. She thought the net
      caps were beautiful; she thought the exquisite cleanness of everything was
      like a perfume&mdash;&ldquo;the perfume of a wild rose!&rdquo; she said, ecstatically.
      She thought the having everything in common was the way to live. &ldquo;And just
      think how peaceful it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; Lewis said; &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s peaceful&mdash;after a fashion.
      Anything that isn&rsquo;t alive is peaceful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But their idea of brotherhood is the highest kind of life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only fault I have to find with it is that it isn&rsquo;t human,&rdquo; he said,
      mildly. He had no desire to prove or disprove anything; Athalia was
      looking better, just because she was interested in something, and that was
      enough for Lewis. When she proposed to read a book on Shakerism aloud, he
      fell into her mood with what was, for him, enthusiasm; he declared he
      would like nothing better, and he put his daily paper aside without a
      visible regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;I must say there&rsquo;s more to it than I supposed.
      They&rsquo;ve studied the Prophecies; that&rsquo;s evident. And they&rsquo;re not narrow in
      their belief. They&rsquo;re really Unitarians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Narrow?&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;they are as wide as heaven itself! And, oh, the
      peace of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they are NOT human,&rdquo; he would insist, smiling; &ldquo;no marriage&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      not human, little Tay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not until two months later that he began to feel vaguely uneasy.
      &ldquo;Yes; it&rsquo;s interesting,&rdquo; he admitted; &ldquo;but nobody in these days would want
      to be a Shaker.&rdquo; To which she replied, boldly, &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was all, but it was enough. Lewis Hall&rsquo;s face suddenly sobered. He
      had not stumbled along behind her in all her emotional experiences without
      learning to read the guide-posts to her thought. &ldquo;I hope she&rsquo;ll get
      through with it soon,&rdquo; he said to himself, with a worried frown; &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t
      wholesome for a mind like &lsquo;Thalia&rsquo;s to dwell on this kind of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was in November that she broke to him that she had written Eldress
      Hannah to ask if she might come and visit the community, and had been
      answered &ldquo;Yee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis was silent with consternation; he went out to the sawmill and
      climbed up into the loft to think it all out alone. Should he forbid it?
      He knew that was nonsense; in the first place, his conception of the
      relation of husband and wife did not include that kind of thing; but more
      than that, opposition would, he said to himself, &ldquo;push her in.&rdquo; Not into
      Shakerism; &ldquo;&lsquo;Thalia couldn&rsquo;t be a Shaker to save her life,&rdquo; he thought,
      with an involuntary smile; but into an excited discontent with her
      comfortable, prosaic life. No; definite opposition to the visit must not
      be thought of&mdash;but he must try and persuade her not to go. How? What
      plea could he offer? His own loneliness without her he could not bring
      himself to speak of; he shrank from taking what seemed to him an
      advantage. He might urge that she would find it cold and uncomfortable in
      those old frame houses high up on the hills; or that it would be bad for
      her health to take the rather wearing journey at this time of year. But he
      knew too well how little effect any such prudent counsels would have. The
      very fact that her interest had lasted for more than three months showed
      that it had really struck roots into her mind, and mere prudence would not
      avail much. Still, he would urge prudence; then, if she was determined,
      she must go. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll get sick of it in a fortnight,&rdquo; he said; but for the
      present he must let her have her head, even if she was making a mistake.
      She had a right to have her head, he reminded himself&mdash;&ldquo;but I must
      tell those people to keep her warm, she takes cold so easily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up and looked out of the window; below, in the race, there was a
      jam of logs, and the air was keen with the pungent smell of sawdust and
      new boards. The whir and thud of the machinery down-stairs sent a faint
      quiver through the planks under his feet. &ldquo;The mill will net a good profit
      this year,&rdquo; he said to himself, absently. &ldquo;&lsquo;Thalia can have pretty nearly
      anything she wants.&rdquo; And even as he said it he had a sudden, vague
      misgiving: if she didn&rsquo;t have everything she wanted, perhaps she would be
      happier? But the idea was too new and too subtle to follow up, so the
      result of that troubled hour in the mill-chamber was only that he made no
      very resolute objection to Athalia&rsquo;s acceptance of Eldress Hannah&rsquo;s
      permission to come. It had been given grudgingly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family were gathered in the sitting-room; they had had their supper&mdash;the
      eight elderly women and the three elderly men, all that were left of the
      community. The room had the austere and shining cleanness which Athalia
      had called a perfume, but it was full of homely comfort. A blue-and-white
      rag carpet in the centre left a border of bare floor, painted
      pumpkin-yellow; there was a glittering airtight stove with isinglass
      windows that shone like square, red eyes; a gay patchwork cushion in the
      seat of a rocking-chair was given up to the black cat, whose sleek fur
      glistened in the lamplight. Three of the sisters knitted silently; two
      others rocked back and forth, their tired, idle hands in their laps, their
      eyes closed; the other three yawned, and spoke occasionally between
      themselves of their various tasks. Brother Nathan read his weekly FARMER;
      Brother William turned over the leaves of a hymn-book and appeared to
      count them with noiseless, moving lips; Brother George cut pictures out of
      the back of a magazine, yawning sometimes, and looking often at his watch.
      Into this quietness Eldress Hannah&rsquo;s still voice came:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard from Lydia again.&rdquo; There was a faint stir, but no one spoke.
      &ldquo;The Lord is dealing with her,&rdquo; Eldress Hannah said; &ldquo;she is in great
      misery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brother George nodded. &ldquo;That is good; He works in a mysterious way&mdash;she&rsquo;s
      real miserable, is she? Well, well; that&rsquo;s good. The mercies of the Lord
      are everlasting,&rdquo; he ended, in a satisfied voice, and began to read again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen!&mdash;amen!&rdquo; said Brother William, vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Lydy!&rdquo; Brother Nathan murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I had another letter,&rdquo; the Eldress proceeded, &ldquo;from that young woman
      who came here in August&mdash;Athalia Hall; do you remember?&mdash;she
      asked two questions to the minute! She wants to visit us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brother Nathan looked at her over his spectacles, and one of the sisters
      opened her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why she should,&rdquo; Eldress Hannah added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of the old brothers nodded agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The curiosity of the world&rsquo;s people does not help their souls,&rdquo; said one
      of the knitters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She thinks we walk in the Way to Peace,&rdquo; said the Eldress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yee; we do,&rdquo; said Brother George.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell her &lsquo;nay&rsquo;?&rdquo; the Eldress questioned, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yee,&rdquo; said Brother George; and the dozing sisters murmured &ldquo;Yee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Brother Nathan; &ldquo;her husband&mdash;HE has something to him.
      Let her come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if she visited us, how would that affect him?&rdquo; Eldress Hannah asked,
      surprised into faint animation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she was moved to stay it would affect him,&rdquo; Brother Nathan said,
      dryly; &ldquo;he would come, too, and there are very few of us left, Eldress. He
      would be a great gain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. Brother William&rsquo;s gray head sagged on his
      shoulder, and the hymn-book slipped from his gnarled old hands. The
      knitting sisters began, one after another, to stab their needles into
      their balls of gray yarn and roll their work up in their aprons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting late, Eldress,&rdquo; one of them said, and glanced at the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell her she may come?&rdquo; said Eldress Hannah, reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can make the wrath of man to praise Him,&rdquo; Brother Nathan encouraged
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yee; but I never heard that He could make the foolishness of woman do
      it,&rdquo; the old woman said, grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the brothers and sisters parted at the door of the sitting-room Brother
      Nathan plucked at the Eldress&rsquo;s sleeve; &ldquo;Is she very wretched&mdash;Lydia?
      Where is she now, Eldress? Poor Lydy! poor little Lydy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fortnight of Athalia&rsquo;s absence wore greatly upon her husband.
      Apprehension lurked in the back of his mind. In the mill, or out on the
      farm, or when he sat down among his shabby, old, calf-skin books, he was
      assailed by the memory of all her various fancies during their married
      life. Some of them were no more remarkable or unexpected than this
      interest in Shakerism. He began to be slowly frightened. Suppose she
      should take it into her head&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      When her fortnight was nearly up and he was already deciding whether, when
      he drove over to Depot Corners to meet her, he would take Ginny&rsquo;s colt or
      the new mare, a letter came to say she was going to stay a week longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; she wrote&mdash;her very pen, in the frantic down-hill slope
      of her lines, betraying the excitement of her thoughts&mdash;&ldquo;I believe
      that for the first time in my life I have found my God!&rdquo; The letter was
      full of dashes and underlining, and on the last page there was a blistered
      splash into which the ink had run a little on the edges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis Hall&rsquo;s heart contracted with an almost physical pang. &ldquo;I must go and
      get her right off,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;this thing is serious!&rdquo; And yet, after a
      wakeful night, he decided, with the extraordinary respect for her
      individuality so characteristic of the man&mdash;a respect that may be
      called foolish or divine, as you happen to look at it&mdash;he decided not
      to go. If he dragged her away from the Shakers against her will, what
      would be gained? &ldquo;I must give her her head, and let her see for herself
      that it&rsquo;s all moonshine,&rdquo; he told himself, painfully, over and over; &ldquo;my
      seeing it won&rsquo;t accomplish anything.&rdquo; But he counted the hours until she
      would come home.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came, as soon as he saw her walking along the platform looking
      for him while he stood with his hand on Ginny&rsquo;s colt&rsquo;s bridle, even before
      she had spoken a single word, even then he knew what had happened&mdash;the
      uplifted radiance of her face announced it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not tell him at once. On the drive home, in the dark December
      afternoon, he was tense with apprehension; once or twice he ventured some
      questions about the Shakers, but she put them aside with a curious
      gentleness, her voice a little distant and monotonous; her words seemed to
      come only from the surface of her mind. When he lifted her out of the
      sleigh at their own door he felt a subtle resistance in her whole body;
      and when, in the hall, he put his arms about her and tried to kiss her,
      she drew back sharply and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&mdash;PLEASE!&rdquo; Then, as they stood there in the chilly entry, she
      burst into a passionate explanation: she had been convicted and converted!
      She had found her Saviour! She&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, little Tay,&rdquo; he broke in, sadly; &ldquo;supper is ready, dear.&rdquo;
       He heard a smothered exclamation&mdash;that it was smothered showed how
      completely she was immersed in a new experience, one of the details of
      which was the practice of self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, of course, that night they had it out.... When they came into the
      sitting-room after supper she flung the news into his pale face: <i>she
      wished to join the Shakers</i>. But she must have his consent, she added,
      impatiently, because otherwise the Shakers would not let her come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only thing I don&rsquo;t agree with them about,&rdquo; she said, candidly;
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they ought to make anything so solemn contingent upon the
      &lsquo;consent&rsquo; of any other human being. But, of course, Lewis, it&rsquo;s only a
      form. I have left you in spirit, and that is what counts. So I told them I
      knew you would consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with those blue, ecstatic eyes, so oblivious to his pain
      that for a moment a sort of impersonal amazement at such self-centredness
      held him silent. But after the first shock he spoke with a slow fluency
      that pierced Athalia&rsquo;s egotism and stirred an answering astonishment in
      her. His weeks of vague misgiving, deepening into keen apprehension, had
      given him protests and arguments which, although they never convinced her,
      silenced her temporarily. She had never known her husband in this
      character. Of course, she had been prepared for objections and entreaties,
      but sound arguments and stern disapproval confused and annoyed her. She
      had supposed he would tell her she would break his heart; instead, he
      said, calmly, that she hadn&rsquo;t the head for Shakerism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to be very reasonable, &lsquo;Thalia, to stand a community life, or
      else you&rsquo;ve got to be an awful fool. You are neither one nor the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe their doctrines,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;and I would die for a
      religious belief. But I don&rsquo;t suppose you ever felt that you could die for
      a thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have&mdash;after a fashion,&rdquo; he said, mildly; &ldquo;but dying for a
      thing is easy; it&rsquo;s living for it that&rsquo;s hard. You couldn&rsquo;t keep it up,
      Athalia; you couldn&rsquo;t live for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, of course, that night was only the beginning. The days and weeks
      that followed were full of argument, of entreaty, of determination.
      Perhaps if he had laughed at her.... But it is dangerous to laugh at
      unhumorous people, for if they get angry all is lost. So he never laughed,
      nor in all their talks did he ever reproach her for not loving him. Once
      only his plea was personal&mdash;and even then it was only indirectly so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Athalia,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s only one kind of pain in this world that
      never gets cured. It&rsquo;s the pain that comes when you remember that you&rsquo;ve
      made somebody who loved you unhappy&mdash;not for a principle, but for
      your own pleasure. I know that pain, and I know how it lasts. Once I did
      something, just to please myself, that hurt mother&rsquo;s feelings. I&rsquo;d give my
      right hand if I hadn&rsquo;t done it. It&rsquo;s twenty-two years ago, and I wasn&rsquo;t
      more than a boy, and she forgave me and forgot all about it. I have never
      forgotten it. I wish to God I could! &lsquo;Thalia, I don&rsquo;t want you to suffer
      that kind of pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw the implication rather than the warning, and she burst out,
      angrily, that she wasn&rsquo;t doing this for &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo;; she was doing it for
      principle! It was for the salvation of her soul!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Athalia,&rdquo; he said, solemnly, &ldquo;the salvation of our souls depends on doing
      our duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she broke in, triumphantly, &ldquo;out of your own lips:&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it my
      duty to do what seems to me right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He considered a minute. &ldquo;Well, yes; I suppose the most valuable example
      any one can set is to do what he or she believes to be right. It may be
      wrong, but that is not the point. We must do what we conceive to be our
      duty. Only, we&rsquo;ve got to be sure, Tay, in deciding upon duty, in deciding
      what is right,&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got to be sure that self-interest is
      eliminated. I don&rsquo;t believe anybody can decide absolutely on what is right
      without eliminating self.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She frowned at this impatiently; its perfect fairness meant nothing to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You promised to be my wife,&rdquo; he went on with a curious sternness; &ldquo;it is
      obviously &lsquo;right,&rsquo; and so it is your first duty to keep your promise&mdash;at
      least, so long as my conduct does not absolve you from it.&rdquo; Then he added,
      hastily, with careful justice: &ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m not talking about promises
      to love; they are nonsense. Nobody can promise to love. Promises to do our
      duty are all that count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was the only reproach he made&mdash;if it was a reproach&mdash;for
      his betrayed love. It was just as well. Discussion on this subject between
      husbands and wives is always futile. Nothing was ever accomplished by it;
      and yet, in spite of the verdict of time and experience that nothing is
      gained, over and over the jealous man, and still more frequently the
      jealous woman, protests against a lost love with a bitterness that kills
      pity and turns remorse into antagonism. But Lewis Hall made no reproaches.
      Perhaps Athalia missed them; perhaps, under her spiritual passion, she was
      piqued that earthly passion was so readily silenced. But, if she was, she
      did not know it. She was entirely sincere and intensely happy in a new
      experience. It was a long winter of argument;&mdash;and then suddenly, in
      early April, the break came....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I WILL go; I have a right to save my soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he said, very simply, &ldquo;Well, Athalia, then I&rsquo;ll go, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You? But you don&rsquo;t believe&mdash;&rdquo; And almost in the Bible words he
      answered her, &ldquo;No; but where you go, I will go; where you live, I will
      live.&rdquo; And then, a moment later, &ldquo;I promised to cleave to you, little
      Tay.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE uprooting of their life took a surprisingly short time. In all those
      dark months of argument Lewis Hall had been quietly making plans for this
      final step, and such preparation betrayed his knowledge from the first of
      the hopelessness of his struggle&mdash;indeed, the struggle had only been
      loyalty to a lost cause. His calm assent to his wife&rsquo;s ultimatum left her
      a little blank; but in the immediate excitement of removal, in the thrill
      of martyrdom that came with publicity, the blankness did not last. What
      the publicity was to her husband she could not understand. He received the
      protests of his family in stolid silence; when the venturesome great-aunt
      told him what she thought of him, he smiled; when his brother informed him
      that he was a fool, he said he shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. When the minister, egged
      on by distracted Hall relatives, remonstrated, he replied, respectfully,
      that he was doing what he believed to be his duty, &ldquo;and if it seems to be
      a duty, I can&rsquo;t help myself; you see that, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he said, anxiously.
      But that was practically all he found to say; for the most part he was
      silent. Athalia, in her absorption, probably had not the slightest idea of
      the agonies of mortification which he suffered; her imagination told her,
      truly enough, what angry relatives and pleasantly horrified neighbors said
      about her, and the abuse exhilarated her very much; but her imagination
      stopped there. It did not give her the family&rsquo;s opinion of her husband; it
      did not whisper the gossip of the grocery-store and the post-office; it
      did not repeat the chuckles or echo the innuendoes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Squire Hall&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s got tired of him? Rather live with the Shakers
      than him!&rdquo; &ldquo;I like Hall, but I haven&rsquo;t any sympathy with him,&rdquo; the doctor
      said; &ldquo;what in thunder did he let her go gallivanting off to visit the
      Shakers for? Might have known a female like Mrs. Hall&rsquo;d get a bee in her
      bonnet. He ought to have kept her at home. <i>I</i> would have. I wouldn&rsquo;t
      have had any such nonsense in my family! Well, for an obstinate man (and
      he IS obstinate, you know), the squire, when it comes to his wife, has no
      more backbone than a wet string.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonder if there&rsquo;s anything under it all?&rdquo; came the sly insinuation of
      gossip; &ldquo;wonder if she hasn&rsquo;t got something besides the Shakers up her
      sleeve? You wait!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Athalia&rsquo;s imagination spared her these comments, Lewis&rsquo;s unimaginative
      common sense supplied them. He knew what other men and husbands were
      saying about him; what servants and gossip and friends insinuated to one
      another, and set his jaw in silence. He made no excuse and no explanation.
      Why should he? The facts spoke. His wife did prefer the Shakers to her
      husband and her home. To have interfered with her purpose by any plea of
      his personal unhappiness, or by any threat of an appeal to law, or even by
      refusing to give the &ldquo;consent&rdquo; essential to her admission, would not have
      altered these facts. As for his reasons for going with her, they would not
      have enhanced his dignity in the eyes of the men who wouldn&rsquo;t have had any
      such nonsense in their families: he must be near her to see that she did
      not suffer too much hardship, and to bring her home when she was ready to
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days of tearing his life up by the roots the silent man was just
      a little more silent, that was all. But the fact was burning into his
      consciousness: he couldn&rsquo;t keep his wife! That was what they said, and
      that was the truth. It seemed to him as if his soul blushed at his
      helplessness. But his face was perfectly stolid. He told Athalia,
      passively, that he had rented the house and mill to Henry Davis; that he
      had settled half his capital upon her, so that she would have some money
      to put into the common treasury of the community; then he added that he
      had taken a house for himself near the settlement, and that he would hire
      out to the Shakers when they were haying, or do any farm-work that he
      could get.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can take care of myself, I guess,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I used to camp out when I
      was a boy, and I can cook pretty well, mother always said.&rdquo; He looked at
      her wistfully; but the uncomfortable-ness of such an arrangement did not
      strike her. In her desire for a new emotion, her eagerness to FEEL&mdash;that
      eagerness which is really a sensuality of the mind&mdash;she was too
      absorbed in her own self-chosen hardships to think of his; which were not
      entirely self-chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can find enough to do,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the Shakers need an
      able-bodied man; they only have those three old men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; she asked, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to see them twice this winter,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why!&rdquo; she said, amazed, &ldquo;you never told me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t tell you everything nowadays, &lsquo;Thalia,&rdquo; he said, briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those two visits to the Shakers, Lewis Hall had been treated with great
      delicacy; there had been no effort to proselytize, and equally there had
      been no triumphing over the accession of his wife; in fact, Athalia was
      hardly referred to, except when they told him that they would take good
      care of her, and when Brother Nathan volunteered a brief summary of Shaker
      doctrines&mdash;&ldquo;so as you can feel easy about her,&rdquo; he explained: &ldquo;We
      believe that Christ was the male principle in Deity, and Mother Ann was
      the female principle. And we believe in confession of our sins, and
      communion with the dead&mdash;spiritualism, they call it nowadays&mdash;and
      in the virgin life. Shakers don&rsquo;t marry, nor give in marriage. And we have
      all things in common. That&rsquo;s all, friend. You see, we don&rsquo;t teach anything
      that Christ didn&rsquo;t teach, so she won&rsquo;t learn any evil from us. Simple,
      ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, after a fashion,&rdquo; Lewis Hall said; &ldquo;but it isn&rsquo;t human.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Brother Nathan smiled mystically. &ldquo;Maybe that isn&rsquo;t against it, in the
      long run,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came to the community in the spring twilight. The brothers and
      sisters had assembled to meet the convert, and to give a neighborly hand
      to the silent man who was to live by himself in a little, gray, shingled
      house down on Lonely Lake Road. It was a supreme moment to Athalia. She
      had expected an intense parting from her husband when they left their own
      house; and she was ready to press into her soul the poignant thorn of
      grief, not only because it would make her FEEL, but because it would
      emphasize in her own mind the divine self-sacrifice which she wanted to
      believe she was making. But when the moment came to close the door of the
      old home behind them, her husband was cruelly commonplace about it&mdash;for
      poor Lewis had no more drama in him than a kindly Newfoundland dog! He was
      full of practical cares for his tenant, and he stopped even while he was
      turning the key in the lock, to &ldquo;fuss,&rdquo; as Athalia said, over some last
      details of the transfer of the sawmill. Athalia could not tear herself
      from arms that placidly consented to her withdrawal; so there had been no
      rending ecstasies. In consequence, on the journey up to the community she
      was a little morose, a little irritable even, just as the drunkard is apt
      to be irritable when sobriety is unescapable.... But at the door of the
      Family House she had her opportunity: she said, dramatically, &ldquo;Good-night&mdash;<i>Brother
      Lewis</i>.&rdquo; It was an entirely sincere moment. Dramatic natures are not
      often insincere, they are only unreal.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for her husband, he said, calmly, &ldquo;Good-night, dear,&rdquo; and trudged off
      in the cool May dusk down Lonely Lake Road. He found the door of the house
      on the latch, and a little fire glowing in the stove; Brother Nathan had
      seen to that, and had left some food on the table for him. But in spite of
      the old man&rsquo;s friendly foresight the house had all the desolation of
      confusion; in the kitchen there were two or three cases of books, broken
      open but not unpacked, a trunk and a carpet-bag, and some bundles of
      groceries; they had been left by the expressman on tables and chairs and
      on the floor, so that the solitary man had to do some lifting and
      unpacking before he could sit down in his loneliness to eat the supper
      Brother Nathan had provided. He looked about to see where he would put up
      shelves for his books, and as he did so the remembrance of his quiet,
      shabby old study came to him, almost like a blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;this won&rsquo;t be for so very long. We&rsquo;ll be back
      again in a year, I guess. Poor little Tay! I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if it was
      six months. I wonder, can I buy Henry Davis off, if she wants to go back
      in six months?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And yet, in spite of his calm understanding of the situation, the wound
      burned. As he went about putting things into some semblance of order, he
      paused once and looked hard into the fire.... When she did want to go back&mdash;let
      it be in six months or six weeks or six days&mdash;would things be the
      same? Something had been done to the very structure and fabric of their
      life. &ldquo;Can it ever be the same?&rdquo; he said to himself; and then he passed
      his hand over his eyes, in a bewildered way&mdash;&ldquo;Will I be the same?&rdquo; he
      said.

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      SUMMER at the Shaker settlement, lying in the green cup of the hills, was
      very beautiful. The yellow houses along the grassy street drowsed in the
      sunshine, and when the wind stirred the maple leaves one could see the
      distant sparkle of the lake. Athalia had a fancy, in the warm twilights,
      for walking down Lonely Lake Road, that jolted over logs and across
      gullies and stopped abruptly at the water&rsquo;s edge. She had to pass Lewis&rsquo;s
      house on the way, and if he saw her he would call out to her, cheerfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, &lsquo;Thalia! how are you, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she, with prim intensity, would reply, &ldquo;Good-evening, BROTHER Lewis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If one of the sisters was with her, they would stop and speak to him;
      otherwise she passed him by in such an eager consciousness of her part
      that he smiled&mdash;and then sighed. When she had a companion, Lewis and
      the other Shakeress would gossip about the weather or the haying, and
      Lewis would have the chance to say: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not overworking, &lsquo;Thalia?
      You&rsquo;re not tired?&rdquo; While Athalia, in her net cap and her gray shoulder
      cape buttoned close up to her chin, would dismiss the anxious affection
      with a peremptory &ldquo;Of course not! I have bread to eat you know not of,
      Brother Lewis.&rdquo; Then she would add, didactically, some word of dogma or
      admonition.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had not much time to give to Brother Lewis&rsquo;s salvation&mdash;she
      was so busy in adjusting herself to her new life. Its picturesque details
      fascinated her&mdash;the cap, the brevity of speech, the small mannerisms,
      the occasional and very reserved mysticism, absorbed her so that she
      thought very little of her husband. She saw him occasionally on those
      walks down to the lake, or when, after a day in the fields with the three
      old Shaker men, Brother Nathan brought him home to supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We Shakers are given to hospitality,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re always looking for
      the angel we are going to entertain unawares. Come along home with us,
      Lewis.&rdquo; And Lewis would plod up the hill and take his turn at the tin
      washbasin, and then file down the men&rsquo;s side of the stairs to the
      dining-room, where he and the three old brothers sat at one table, and
      Athalia and the eight sisters sat at the other table. After supper he had
      the chance to see Athalia and to make sure that she was not looking tired.
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t take cold yesterday, &lsquo;Thalia? I saw you were out in the rain,&rdquo;
       he would say. And she, always a little embarrassed at such personal
      interest, would reply, primly, &ldquo;I am not at all tired, Brother Lewis.&rdquo;
       Nathan used to walk home with his guest, and sometimes they talked of work
      that must be done, and sometimes touched on more unpractical things&mdash;those
      spiritual manifestations which at rare intervals centred in Brother
      William and were the hope of the whole community. For who could tell when
      the old man&rsquo;s incoherent muttering would break into the clear speech of
      one of those Heavenly Visitants who, in the early days, had descended upon
      the Shakers, and then, for some divine and deeply mysterious reason,
      withdrawn from such pure channels of communication, and manifested
      themselves in the world,&mdash;but through base and sordid natures. Poor,
      vague Brother William, who saw visions and dreamed dreams, was, in this
      community, the torch that held a smouldering spark of the divine fire, and
      when, in a cataleptic state, his faint intelligence fluttered back into
      some dim depths of personality, and he moaned and muttered, using awful
      names with babbling freedom, Brother Nathan and the rest listened with
      pathetic eagerness for a <i>&ldquo;thus saith the Lord,&rdquo;</i> which should
      enflame the gray embers of Shakerism and give light to the whole world!
      When Nathan talked of these things he would add, with a sigh, that he
      hoped some day William would be inspired to tell them something more of
      Sister Lydia: &ldquo;Once William said, &lsquo;Coming, coming.&rsquo; <i>I</i> think it
      meant Lydia; but Eldress thought it was Athalia; it was just before she
      came.&rdquo; Brother Nathan sighed. &ldquo;I wish it had meant Lydy,&rdquo; he said, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Lewis wished it had meant Lydy, he did not say so. And, indeed, he said
      very little upon any subject; Brother Nathan did most of the talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fled from the City of Destruction when I was thirty,&rdquo; he told Lewis;
      &ldquo;that was just a year before Sister Lydy left us. Poor Lydy! poor Lydy!&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;Oh, yee, <i>I</i> know the world. I know it, my boy! Do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, after a fashion,&rdquo; Lewis said; and then he asked, suddenly, &ldquo;Why did
      you turn Shaker, Nathan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I got hold of a Shaker book that set me thinking. Sister Lydia gave
      it to me. I met Sister Lydia when she had come down to the place I lived
      to sell baskets. And she was interested in my salvation, and gave me the
      book. Then I got to figuring out the Prophecies, and I saw Shakerism
      fulfilled them; and then I began to see that when you don&rsquo;t own anything
      yourself you can&rsquo;t worry about your property; well, that clinched me, I
      guess. Poor Sister Lydia, she didn&rsquo;t abide in grace herself,&rdquo; he ended,
      sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought you would have been sorry then, that you&mdash;&rdquo;
       Lewis began, but checked himself. &ldquo;How about&rdquo;&mdash;he said, and stopped
      to clear his voice, which broke huskily;&mdash;&ldquo;how about love between man
      and woman? Husband and wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marriage is honorable,&rdquo; Brother Nathan conceded; &ldquo;Shakers don&rsquo;t despise
      marriage. But they like to see folks grow out of it into something better,
      like&mdash;like your wife, maybe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, your doctrine would put an end to the world,&rdquo; Lewis said, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; said Brother Nathan, dryly, &ldquo;there ain&rsquo;t any immediate danger
      of the world coming to an end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see that book,&rdquo; Lewis said, when they parted at the
      pasture-bars where a foot-path led down the hill to his own house.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that night Brother Nathan had an eager word for the family. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      asked for a book!&rdquo; he said. The Eldress smiled doubtfully, but Athalia,
      with a rapturous upward look, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May the Lord guide him!&rdquo; then added, practically, &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t amount to
      anything. He thinks Shakerism isn&rsquo;t human.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not against it, that&rsquo;s not against it!&rdquo; Nathan declared, smiling;
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told him so a dozen times!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Athalia was so happy that first year, and so important, that she did
      not often concern herself with the welfare of the man who had been her
      husband. Instead&mdash;it was early in April&mdash;he concerned himself
      with hers; he tried, tentatively, to see if it wasn&rsquo;t almost time for
      Athalia &ldquo;to get through with it.&rdquo; Of course, afterward, Sister Athalia
      realized, with chagrin, that this attempt was only a forerunner of the
      fever that was developing, which in a few days was to make him a very sick
      man. But for the moment his question seemed to her a temptation of the
      devil, and, of course, resisted temptation made her faith stronger than
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a deliciously cold spring night; Lewis had drawn the table, with
      his books on it, close to the fire to try to keep warm, but he shivered,
      even while his shoulders scorched, and somehow he could not keep his mind
      on the black, rectangular characters of the Hebrew page before him. He had
      been interested in Brother Nathan&rsquo;s explanation of Hosea&rsquo;s forecasting of
      Shakerism, and he had admitted to himself that, if Nathan was correct,
      there would be something to be said for Shakerism. The idea made him
      vaguely uneasy, because, that &ldquo;something&rdquo; might be so conclusive, that&mdash;But
      he could not face such a possibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to dig at the text, so that he might refute Nathan; but somehow
      that night he was too dull to refute anybody, and by-and-by he pushed the
      black-lettered page aside, and, crouching over the fire, held out his
      hands to the blaze. He thought, vaguely, of the big fireplace in the old
      study, and suddenly, in the chilly numbness of his mind, he saw it&mdash;with
      such distinctness that he was startled. Then, a moment later, it changed
      into the south chamber that had been his mother&rsquo;s bedroom&mdash;he could
      even detect the faint scent of rose-geranium that always hung about her;
      he noticed that the green shutters on the west windows were bowed, and
      from between them a line of sunshine fell across the matting on the floor
      and touched the four-poster that had a chintz spread and valance. How well
      he knew the faded roses and the cockatoos on that old chintz! Over there
      by the window he had caught her crying that time he had hurt her feelings,
      &ldquo;just for his own pleasure&rdquo;; the old stab of this thought pierced through
      the feverish mists and touched the quick. He struggled numbly with the
      visualization of fever, brushing his hot hand across his eyes and trying
      to see which was real&mdash;the geranium-sweet south chamber or the chilly
      house on Lonely Lake Road. Athalia had given him pain in that same way&mdash;just
      for her own pleasure. Poor little Tay! He was afraid it would hurt her,
      some day, when she realized it; well, when she came to herself, when she
      got through her playing at Shakerism, he must not let her know how great
      the pain had been; she would suffer too much if she should understand his
      misery: and Athalia didn&rsquo;t bear suffering well.... But how long she had
      been getting over Shakerism! He had thought it would only last six months,
      and here it was a year! Well, if Nathan&rsquo;s reading of the Prophecies was
      right, then Athalia would never get over it. She ought never to get over
      it. Then what would become of the farm and the sawmill? And instantly
      everything was unreal again; he could hear the hum of the driving-wheel
      and the screech of the saw tearing through a log; how fragrant the fresh
      planks were, and the great heaps of sawdust&mdash;but the noise made his
      head ache; and&mdash;and the fire didn&rsquo;t seem hot....
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in one of those moments when the mists thinned, and he knew that he
      was shivering over the stove instead of basking in the sunshine in his
      mother&rsquo;s room that smelled of rose-geranium leaves, that Athalia came in.
      She looked conscious and confused, full of a delightful embarrassment at
      being for once alone with him. The color was deep on her cheeks, and her
      eyes were starry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eldress asked me to bring your mail down to you, Brother Lewis,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thalia!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I am so glad to see you, dear; I&mdash;I seem to be
      rather used up, somehow.&rdquo; The mists had quite cleared away, but a violent
      headache made his words stumble. &ldquo;I was just wondering, Thalia&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      you think you might go home now? You&rsquo;ve had a whole year of it&mdash;and I
      really ought to go home&mdash;the mill&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Lewis Hall! What do you mean!&rdquo; she said, forgetting her part in her
      indignation. &ldquo;I am a Shakeress. You&rsquo;ve no right to speak so to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He blinked at her through the blur of pain. &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d stay with me,
      Athalia, I&rsquo;ve got a&mdash;a sort of&mdash;headache. Never mind about being
      a Shakeress just for to-night. It would be such a comfort to have you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Athalia, with a horrified look, had left him. She fled home in the
      darkness with burning cheeks; she debated with herself whether she should
      tell Eldress how her husband&mdash;no, Brother Lewis&mdash;had tried to
      &ldquo;tempt&rdquo; her back to him. In her excitement at this lure of the devil she
      even wondered whether Lewis had pretended that he was ill, to induce her
      to stay with him? But even Athalia&rsquo;s imagination could not compass such a
      thought of Lewis for more than a moment, so she only told the Eldress that
      Brother Lewis had &ldquo;tried to persuade her to go back to the world with
      him.&rdquo; The Lord had defended her, she said, excitedly, and she had
      forbidden him to speak to her!
    </p>
    <p>
      Eldress Hannah looked perplexed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not like Lewis. I wonder&mdash;&rdquo;
       But she did not say what she wondered. Instead, she went early in the
      morning down Lonely Lake Road to Lewis&rsquo;s house. The poor fellow was
      entirely in the mists by that time, shivering and burning and quite
      unconscious, saying over and over, &ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t stay; she wouldn&rsquo;t stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Lure her back,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Eldress Hannah, with a snort. &ldquo;Poor boy! It&rsquo;s good
      riddance for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Eldress Hannah stayed, and Brother Nathan joined her, and for many
      days the little community was shaken with real anxiety, for they had all
      come to love the solitary, waiting husband. Athalia, abashed, but still
      cherishing the dear insult of having been tempted, took what little part
      Eldress allowed her in the care of the sick man; but in the six or seven
      weeks of his illness Brother Nathan and the Eldress were his devoted
      nurses, and by-and-by a genuine friendship grew up between them. Old
      Eldress Hannah&rsquo;s shrewd good-humor was as wholesome as a sound winter
      apple, and Nathan had a gayety Lewis had never suspected. The old man grew
      very confidential in those days of Lewis&rsquo;s convalescence; he showed his
      simple heart with a generosity that made the sick man&rsquo;s lip tighten once
      or twice and his eyes blur;&mdash;Lewis came to know all about Sister
      Lydia; indeed, he knew more than the old man knew himself. When the
      invalid grew stronger, Nathan wrestled with him over the Prophecies, and
      Lewis studied them and the other foundation-stones of the Shaker faith
      with a constantly increasing anxiety. &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he said, with a nervous
      blink, &ldquo;if you ARE right&mdash;&rdquo; But he left the sentence unfinished. Once
      he said, with a feeble passion&mdash;for he was still very weak&mdash;&ldquo;I
      tell you, Nathan, it isn&rsquo;t human!&rdquo; and then added, under his breath, &ldquo;but
      God knows whether that&rsquo;s not in its fa-vor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he was quite well again he was plainly preoccupied. He pored over the
      Prophecies with a concentration that made him blind even to Athalia&rsquo;s
      tired looks. Once, when some one said in his presence, &ldquo;Sister &lsquo;Thalia is
      working too hard,&rdquo; he blinked at her in an absent way before the old,
      anxious attention awoke in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Athalia tossed her head and said, &ldquo;Brother Lewis has his own affairs to
      think of, I guess!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he said, eagerly: &ldquo;Yes, &lsquo;Thalia; I have been thinking&mdash;Some day
      I&rsquo;ll tell you. But not yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I haven&rsquo;t time to pry into other people&rsquo;s thoughts,&rdquo; she said,
      acidly. And, indeed, just then her time was very full. She was enormously
      useful to the community that second winter; her young power and strength
      shone out against the growing weariness of the old sisters. &ldquo;Athalia&rsquo;s
      capable,&rdquo; Eldress Hannah said, and the other sisters said &ldquo;Yee,&rdquo; and
      smiled at one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She IS useful,&rdquo; Sister Jane declared; &ldquo;do you know, she got through the
      churning before nine? I&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo; been at it until eleven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Athalia is like one of those candles that have a streak of soft wax in
      &lsquo;em,&rdquo; Eldress Hannah murmured; &ldquo;but she&rsquo;s useful, as you say, Jane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In January, when the Eldress fell ill, Athalia was especially useful. She
      nursed her with a passion of faithfulness that made the other sisters
      remonstrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll wear yourself out, Athalia; you haven&rsquo;t had your clothes off for
      three days and nights!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord has upheld me, and His right hand has sustained me,&rdquo; Athalia
      quoted, with an uplifted look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yee,&rdquo; old Jane assented, &ldquo;but He likes sense, Athalia, and there ain&rsquo;t
      any reason why two of us shouldn&rsquo;t take turns settin&rsquo; up with her
      tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my service,&rdquo; Athalia said, smiling joyously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eldress Hannah, lying with closed eyes, said, suddenly: &ldquo;Athalia, don&rsquo;t be
      foolish and conceited. You go right along to your bed; Jane and Mary&rsquo;ll
      look after me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It took Athalia a perceptible minute to get herself in hand sufficiently
      to say, meekly, &ldquo;Yee, Eldress.&rdquo; When she had shut the door behind her with
      perhaps something more than Shaker emphasis, the Eldress opened her eyes
      and smiled at old Jane. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s smart,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yee,&rdquo; said Sister Jane; and there was a little chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sick woman closed her eyes again and sighed. &ldquo;What a nurse Lydia was!&rdquo;
       she said; and added, suddenly: &ldquo;How is Nathan getting along with Lewis?
      There isn&rsquo;t much more time, I guess,&rdquo; she ended, mildly; &ldquo;she won&rsquo;t last
      it out another summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s done better than I expected to stay till now,&rdquo; Jane said; and the
      Eldress nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was, perhaps, a natural result of Athalia&rsquo;s abounding energy that
      toward the end of that second winter in the Shaker village she should grow
      irritable. The spring work was very heavy that year. Brother William was
      too feeble to do even the light, pottering tasks that had been allotted to
      him, and his vague babblings about the spirits ceased altogether. In April
      old Jane died, and that put extra burdens on Athalia&rsquo;s capable shoulders.
      &ldquo;But I notice I don&rsquo;t get anything extra for my work, not even thanks!&rdquo;
       she told Lewis, sharply, and forgot to call him &ldquo;Brother.&rdquo; She had walked
      down Lonely Lake Road and stopped at his gate. She looked thinner; her
      forget-me-not eyes were clouded, and there was an impatient line about her
      lips, instead of the faint, ecstatic smile which was part of her early
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s lots of work to be done,&rdquo; he agreed, &ldquo;but when people do it
      together&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;&mdash;she interrupted him, her lip drooping a little
      in a half-contemptuous smile&mdash;&ldquo;they&rsquo;ve heard again from that Sister
      Lydia who ran away! You know who I mean?&mdash;Brother Nathan is always
      talking about her. They think she&rsquo;ll come back. <i>I</i> should say good
      riddance! Though of course if it&rsquo;s genuine repentance I&rsquo;ll be glad. Only I
      don&rsquo;t think it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How pleased Nathan will be!&rdquo; Lewis said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s pleased; he&rsquo;s rather too pleased for a Shaker, it strikes me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lewis frowned. &ldquo;There is joy in the presence of the angels,&rdquo; he reminded
      her, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angels!&rdquo; she said, with a laugh; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe so much in the angels
      as I did before I knew so much about them. I understand that when this
      &lsquo;angel&rsquo; comes back I am to give up my room to her, if you please, because
      it used to be hers. Oh, I&rsquo;m of no importance now&mdash;Lewis,&rdquo; she broke
      off, suddenly, &ldquo;who has our house this year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Davis; he wants to re-lease it in May.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He just takes it by the year, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. &ldquo;Wants a five-years&rsquo; lease next time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t give it to him!&rdquo; she said; and added, frowning: &ldquo;You ought to
      go back yourself, you know. It&rsquo;s foolish for you to be here. Why, it&rsquo;s
      almost two years!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time flies,&rdquo; he said, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed and sighed. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I mean yee&mdash;indeed, it does! I was
      just thinking, Lewis, we&rsquo;ve been married ten years!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, eight years. We were married just eight years,&rdquo; he said, soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The color flew into her face. &ldquo;Oh, yee; we were married eight years when I
      came in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with great tenderness. &ldquo;Athalia, I have to confess to you
      that when you came I didn&rsquo;t think it would last with you. I distrusted the
      Holy Spirit. And I came, myself, against my will, as you know. But now I
      begin to think you were led&mdash;and perhaps you have led me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Athalia gave a little gasp&mdash;&ldquo;WHAT!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure yet,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said Shakerism was unhuman!&rdquo; Athalia protested, with a thrill of
      panic in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he cried, his voice suddenly kindling, &ldquo;you know what Nathan is
      always saying?&mdash;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s not against it&rsquo;? Athalia, its unhumanness, as
      you call it, is why I think it may be of God. The human in us must give
      way to the divine. &lsquo;First that which is natural; then that which is
      spiritual.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; she said, faintly; &ldquo;you are not a Shaker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not yet. But perhaps some day&mdash;I am trying to follow
      you, Athalia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She caught her breath with a frightened look. &ldquo;Follow&mdash;ME?&rdquo; Then she
      burst out crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Tay!&rdquo; he said, bewildered; &ldquo;what is it, dear?&rdquo; But she had left him,
      stumbling blindly as she walked, her face hidden in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis went back into his house, and, lighting his lamp, sat down to pore
      over one of Brother Nathan&rsquo;s books. He was concerned, but he smiled a
      little; it was so like Athalia to cry when she was happy! He did not see
      his wife for several days. The Eldress said Sister &lsquo;Thalia was not well,
      and Lewis looked sorry, but made no comment. He was a little anxious, but
      he did not dwell upon his anxiety. In the next few days he worked hard all
      day in Brother Nathan&rsquo;s herb-house, where the air was hazy with the
      aromatic dust of tansy and pennyroyal, then hurried home at night to sit
      down to his books, so profoundly absorbed in them that sometimes he only
      knew that it was time to sleep because the dawn fell white across the
      black-lettered page.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one night, a week later, when he came home from work, he did not open
      his Bible; he stood a long time in his doorway, looking at the sunset,
      and, as he looked, his face seemed to shine with some inner light. The
      lake was like glass; high in the upper heavens thin golden lines of cloud
      had turned to rippling copper; the sky behind the black circle of the
      hills was a clear, pale green, and in the growing dusk the water whitened
      like snow. &ldquo;&lsquo;Glass mingled with fire,&rsquo;&rdquo; he murmured to himself; &ldquo;yes,
      &lsquo;great and marvellous are Thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are
      Thy ways, Thou King of Saints!&rsquo;&rdquo; And what more marvellous work than this
      wonder of his own salvation? Brought here against his will, against his
      judgment! How he had struggled against the Spirit. He was humbled to the
      earth at the remembrance of it; &ldquo;if I had my way, we wouldn&rsquo;t have walked
      up the hill from the station that morning!&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      The flushing heavens faded into ashes, but the solemn glow of
      half-astonished gratitude lingered on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lewis,&rdquo; some one said in the darkness of the lane&mdash;&ldquo;LEWIS!&rdquo; Athalia
      came up the path swiftly and put her hands on his arm. &ldquo;Lewis, I&mdash;I
      want to go home.&rdquo; She sobbed as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started as if she had struck him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lewis, Lewis, let us go home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The flame of mystical satisfaction went out of his face as a lighted
      candle goes out in the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any home now, Athalia,&rdquo; he said, with a sombre look; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
      only a house. Come in,&rdquo; he added, heavily; &ldquo;we must talk this out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She followed him, and for a moment they neither of them spoke; he fumbled
      about in the warm darkness for a match, and lifting the shade, lighted the
      lamp on the table; then he looked at her. &ldquo;Athalia,&rdquo; he said, in a
      terrified voice, &ldquo;I am&mdash;<i>I am a Shaker!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;no!&rdquo; she said. She grew very white, and sat down,
      breathing quickly. Then the color came back faintly into her lips. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      say it, Lewis; it isn&rsquo;t true. It can&rsquo;t be true!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; he said, with a groan. He had sunk into a chair, and his
      face was hidden in his hands. &ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo; he said,
      hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you mustn&rsquo;t be!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t be&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. You
      can&rsquo;t STAY if I go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must stay,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a stunned silence. Then she said, in an amazed whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! You don&rsquo;t love me any more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still he was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;love&mdash;me,&rdquo; she said, as if repeating some
      astounding fact, which she could not yet believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to gather his courage up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have&mdash;&rdquo; he tried to speak; faltered, broke, went on: &ldquo;I have&mdash;the
      kindliest feelings toward you, &lsquo;Thalia&rdquo;&mdash;his last word was in a
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she protested, with a frightened look&mdash;&ldquo;oh, stop!&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      say THAT!&rdquo; He did not speak; and suddenly, looking at his fixed face, she
      cried out, violently: &ldquo;Oh, why, why did I go up to the graveyard that day?
      Why did you let me?&rdquo; She stared at him, her forget-me-not eyes dilating
      with dismay. &ldquo;It all came from that. If we hadn&rsquo;t walked up the hill that
      morning&mdash;&rdquo; He was speechless. Then, abruptly, she sprang to her feet,
      and, running to him, knelt beside him and tried to pull down the hands in
      which he had again hidden his face. &ldquo;Lewis, it&rsquo;s I&mdash;Tay! You don&rsquo;t
      &lsquo;feel kindly&rsquo; to ME? Lewis, you haven&rsquo;t stopped loving me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a Shaker,&rdquo; he said, helplessly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give up my religion, even
      for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got on his feet and stood before her, his empty palms hanging at his
      sides in that strange gesture of entire hopelessness; he tried to speak,
      but no words came. The lamp on the table flickered a little. Their shadows
      loomed gigantic on the wall behind them; the little hot room was very
      still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think you don&rsquo;t love me?&rdquo; Athalia said, between set teeth; &ldquo;<i>I know
      better!</i>&rdquo; With a laugh she caught his arm with both her shaking hands,
      and kissed him once, and then again. Still he was silent. Then with a cry
      she threw herself against his breast. &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; she said,
      passionately, &ldquo;and you love me! Nothing on earth will make me believe you
      don&rsquo;t love me,&rdquo;&mdash;and for one vital moment her lips burned against
      his.
    </p>
    <p>
      His arms did not close about her,&mdash;but his hands clinched slightly.
      Then he moved back a step or two, and she heard him sigh. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, sister,&rdquo;
       he said, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw up her hands with a frantic gesture. &ldquo;SISTER? My God!&rdquo; she said;
      and left him.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      There was no further struggle between them. A week later she went away. As
      he told her, &ldquo;the house was there&rdquo;&mdash;and to that she went until she
      should go to find some whirl of life that would make her deaf to voices of
      the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Lewis, he did not see that miserable departure from the Family
      House in the shabby old carryall that had been the Shakers&rsquo; one vehicle
      for more than thirty years. He told Nathan he wanted to mow the
      burial-ground up on the hill that morning. From that high and silent spot
      he could see the long white road up from the settlement on one side and
      down to the covered bridge on the other side. He sat under the pine-tree,
      his scythe against the stone wall behind him, his clinched hands between
      his knees. Sitting thus, he watched the road and the slow crawl of the
      shaky old carriage. ... After it had passed the burying-ground and was out
      of sight, he hid his face in his bent elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some ten years afterward that word came to Eldress Hannah that
      Athalia Hall was dying and wanted to see her husband; would he come to
      her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go, Brother Lewis?&rdquo; Eldress asked him, doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yee, if you think best,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do think best,&rdquo; the old woman said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went, a bent, elderly man in a gray coat, threading his wavering way
      through the noisy buffet of the streets of the city where Athalia had
      elected to dwell. He found her in a gaudy hotel, full of the glare of
      pushing, hurrying life. He sat down at her bedside, a little breathless,
      and looked at her with mild, remote eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you forgive me, Lewis?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing to forgive, sister,&rdquo; he told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me that!&rdquo; she cried, with feeble passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked a little bewildered. &ldquo;Yee,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I forgive you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lewis!&mdash;Lewis!&mdash;Lewis!&rdquo; she mourned; &ldquo;this is what I have
      done!&rdquo; She wept pitifully. His face grew vaguely troubled, as if he did
      not quite understand.... Then, abruptly, the veil lifted: his eyes dilated
      with pain; he passed his hand over his forehead once or twice and sighed.
      Then he looked down at the poor, dying face that once he had loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, &lsquo;Thalia!&rdquo; he said, in a surprised and anguished voice; suddenly he
      put his arm under the restless head. &ldquo;There, there, little Tay; don&rsquo;t
      cry,&rdquo; he said, and smiled at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And with that she was content to fall asleep.
    </p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;
 
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
